# General idea 

- This is a short presentation to walk through my proposed ideas for the dissertation briefly. 

- I have a lot of ideas and I'm not sure how much is too much, so I'll present the shortest version I had thought of here and add tasks/extra topics if needed.

- The theme is broadly the **the perception and production at first exposure to third/unknown language words**.

- The basic RQ is the same as I've had thus far: *Does the L1 or the L2 of a bilingual impact the L3?*

- My RQs per experiment will be more specific versions of this question (perception and production)


# Participants

I did a power analysis to determine what sample size was needed for practical equivalence on a within-subjects TOST, and a between subjects t.test (between monolinguals and bilinguals) based on pilot data, with a power level of .8 and the upper and lower equivalence bounds set to -.4 and .4 standard deviations from the mean. 

**Groups**

- 80 Spanish L1 English L2 
- 80 English L1 Spanish L2  
- 50 Spanish monolinguals
- 50 English monolinguals

# Experiment 1 and 2

The purpose of **experiment 1** is to evaluate VOT in beginning L3 learners in each of their known languages and their new language to determine cross-linguistic interactions. 

**Experiment 2** has the same agenda, but instead of VOT, vowels are examined to determine how cross-linguistic interactions may occur. Ideally, an analysis of the same tokens as experiment 1 will be used for experiment 2.


Experiments 1 and 2 would include: 

- A questionnaire
- The LexTALE 
- An elicited production task
- A shadowing task of L3 words

# Questionnaire

This is the questionnaire I made an used for the pilot. I will propose to use it again. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./sim_data/plots/questionnaire.png")

```

# Questionnaire

Page 2 of the questionnaire: 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./sim_data/plots/questionnaire2.png")

```

# Elicited Production Task

I used this in the pilot 

Words are presented in isolation in language specific blocks 

The words are presented in random order, and the language specific-blocks are also in random order, but it was in one session. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./sim_data/plots/ept_example.png")

```

# Shadowing Task Exps 1 and 2

This is an example of the shadowing task, which was presented as the French version of the EPT. The participants saw one word at a time and could play and repeat the word. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./sim_data/plots/shadowing_example.png")

```

# Experiment 3

Experiment 3 is a phoneme categorization task, where participants will here phoneme and chose which category in either English or Spanish best fits what they heard, then they will rate the goodness of fit (continuous slider). I've made a simple version that I intend to add more sounds and options to:

# Alternatives and possible additions 

- Added perception experiments (AX discrimination/AXB discrimination)

- Metaphonological analysis of individual differences (add metaphonological questionnaire and re-analyze data from production and perception tasks)

- Meta-analytic or methods based analysis of previous work (the methods in L3 have been rather questionable)
