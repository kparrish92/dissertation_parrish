OVERVIEW

This is a PsychoPy2 implementation of the LexTALE lexical decision task. 

ABOUT

From http://www.lextale.com: The LexTALE is a quick and practically feasible 
test of vocabulary knowledge for medium to highly proficient speakers of 
English as a second language. It consists of a simple un-speeded visual 
lexical decision task. In contrast to other vocabulary or proficiency tests, 
it has been designed to meet the needs of cognitive researchers. It is quick, 
easy to administer, and free, and yet it is a valid and standardized test of 
vocabulary knowledge. It has also been shown to give a fair indication of 
general English proficiency.

INSTRUCTIONS

Run the lexTALE.psyexp file in PsychoPy2 or the lexTALE.py file from coder. 
Choose either English (en) or Spanish (sp) versions by selecting 'en' or 
'sp' in the 'expInfo' box.
