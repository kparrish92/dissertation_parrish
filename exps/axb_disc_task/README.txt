In this AXB discrimination task, the participants hear a sequence of three monosyllables drawn from a ba-da continuum. The stimuli are presented in a triad in which one of the sounds is different from the other two (AAB, ABB, BAA, BBA). The change trials consisted of stimuli taken from the extremes of the continuum where the first (ABB, BAA) or the third (AAB, BBA) sound belongs to a ‘different category’ (i.e. the other end of the acoustic continuum) than the other two sounds, but the second belonged to the ‘same category’ (i.e. the same end of the continuum) as one of the other two sounds. In 18/54 (33%) of the trials, the participants are presented with three acoustically-different tokens of the same end of the continuum or the ‘same category’ (AAA, BBB). In any given trial there are only three possible answers (first, third, same); for a similar design, see Flege and MacKay (2004), among others. The participants press a key, on a numeric keyboard, to respond; the keys used are ‘1’, ‘0’ and ‘spacebar’.
