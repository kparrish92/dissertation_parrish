# Previous literature in L3 phonology

In the research to date, L3 models have focused largely on morpho-syntax. 
The findings in L3 phonology, on the other hand, have largely yielded mixed results and have not yet been formalized as a model.
Despite the lack of a model, some patterns emerge from the body of research. 
The following sections cover the empirical studies that have been done in L3 production studies across L3 proficiency levels, and the fewer studies done in L3 perception. 


## L3 Production Studies 

The findings in empirical studies of L3 phonological cross-linguistic influence have varied. 
One of the first studies to examine progressive influence of the L1 or L2 on L3 production was the seminal case study of **Williams and Hammarberg (1993)**. 
This study elicited the production of an adult L1 British English, L2 German, and L3 Swedish speaker in the L2 and L3 upon her arrival to Sweden. 
The speech samples were rated for native-likeness by native speakers of German and Swedish respectively, with low ratings (i.e. non-nativeness) being elaborated upon.
In the event of non-native speech, the raters guessed where the speaker in the recording might be from. 
The informant was rated as having near native productions in her L2 German, while her L3 Swedish was rated as being non-native like and to be German-accented. 
The experiment was repeated after 6 months in Sweden, however, and the Swedish raters then judged the informant's Swedish to be British English accented. 

This study constituted evidence of an L2 status effect in the initial stages of L3 phonological acquisition, in which the second learned language influence L3 production, but also provided evidence that this effect diminishes as L3 proficiency increases.
This notion has been called the ‘foreign language effect’ [@meisel_transfer_1983], which refers to the idea that speakers who learn a second non-native language are biased to sound unlike a native speaker of their native language. 

The default L2 status effect has received some empirical support in the L3 phonology literature.
In a study of global accent production, heavier L2 influence in L3 productions was found by L1 Polish, L2 German and L3 English speakers based on ratings of EFL instructors [@wrembel_l2-accented_2010]. 
Similar findings have also been reported in vowel production *[@kamiyama_acquisition_2007]* vowel reduction and speech rhythm [@gut_cross-linguistic_2010].
L2 influence has also been found in VOT productions.
@llama_influence_2010 examined L3 Spanish VOT production by French-English mirror-image bilingual groups and found that both groups had L2-like productions of the L3. 

Other findings in L3 production, however, have yielded mixed results. 
Several studies have found that acoustic properties of the participants' productions fall between L1 and L3 values, suggesting that both the L1 and the L2 have some influence on L3 productions, rather than solely one language. 
For instance, [@wrembel_vot_2014] measured VOT and aspiration in all languages of participants with two different language combinations: L1 Polish, L2 English, and L3 French; (2) L1 Polish, L2 English, and L3 German. 
The results showed that each language had a specific stop-value, and that the L3 VOT productions were intermediate, falling between the L1 and L2 values. 
Similarly, [@wrembel_cross-linguistic_2011] examined thirty-two learners of L3 French with L1 Polish and L2 English who were recorded reading lists of words in carrier phrases. 
As in previous studies [@wrembel_vot_2014], combined transfer from the L1 and the L2 in VOT productions was found. 

Findings of combined L1 and L2 influence in VOT productions were also reported by @wunder_phonological_2010 in L3 Spanish speakers, and by @blank_transferencia_2009 in L3 English speakers who spoke L1 Brazilian Portuguese and L2 French. 
Other studies have found an L1 influence on production despite L3 proficiency [@wrembel_foreign_2012], or in advanced L3 learners [@llama_revisiting_2018].
Importantly, these studies report L3 VOT values which fall between L1 and L2 values. 
Following the suspision that intermediate values might have to do with either sampling issues or proficiency effects, **Parrish (2021)** examined Mexican Spanish-English bilinguals who produced French words in isolation at first exposure to the language. 
The results found that the relative VOT of the L3 fell between their own L1 and L2 values, in line with previous research. 
However, a subsequent analysis of the data suggested that wide individual variation existed in the data, in which some participants produced L3 French as L1 Spanish like, and other produced intermediate, L2-like values. 
Taken together, the results of previous studies suggest that higher samples could reveal group trends and provide better insights into individual variation in crosslinguistic influence.                 


## L3 Perception studies 

Overall, studies in L3 perception have been much more scarce relative to studies in production.
These few studies have often used methods found in L2 speech acquisition research, such as studies testing the predictions of the Perceptual Assimilation Model.
For instance, @wrembel_extending_2019 examined the categorization and discrimination of L3 vowels by 10 young trilinguals who spoke L1 German-L2 English-L3 Polish.
To test categorization, a cross-linguistic similarity task was used in which participants heard minimal pairs of sounds and had to rate how similar sounds were on a 1-7 Likert scale. 
The results showed evidence that participants assimilated L3 sounds to both L1 and L2 categories, but preferred the L2. 
In a second experiment, and AX discrimination task was given to participants to evaluate whether retroflex and palato-alveolar silibant discrimination, a feature of Polish, could be accessed in L3 words.
The results revealed that discrimination of the L1 Polish contrast was very good (84% accuracy), suggesting that L3 learners retain access to the L1.  
Additionally, language specific phonetic discrimination were attended to by even L3 beginners.

Liu 
@liu_effects_2019, which examined the perceptual boundary of a VOT continuum in trilinguals. 
The participants were L3 Spanish speakers who spoke L2 English and L1 Chinese. 
Though the authors focused their analysis on regressive transfer and comparisons to all speakers, the reported boundaries in the study (n = 10, 28ms for Chinese, 24.6ms for English and 23ms for Spanish) suggest that the participants were using their English boundaries for L3 Spanish categorization. 

Werker (1986) - Studied mono, bi and multilingual participants' discrimination of non-native perceptual contrasts and did not find an effect. 

Patihis, Oh and Mogilner (2015) Korean stops by naive mono and multilinguals 
"we compared 56 adults in four groups: monolingual English, bilingual Spanish, bilingual Armenian, and trilingual"
Phoneme discrimination was feature dependent, rather than bilingualism providing a perceptual advantage. 


Onishi (2016) counter-evidence. Korean whose L2 was English and whose L3 was Japanese. 
two perception tasks involving Japanese contrasts and one perception task involving English contrasts.
Both specific contrast experience and general higher language learning experience correlated with better discrimination.


Kopečková (2015) found


@wrembel_cross-linguistic_2020 found that cross-linguistic influence is structure dependent and varies among individuals. 
L2 predominantly influences L3 perception in both rhotic sounds and devoicing of word final stops.

These variable findings of the source of influence in L3 perception and production, including single language influence, combined languages influence, or structure-dependent influence, point to a lack of homogeneity in multilinguals.
